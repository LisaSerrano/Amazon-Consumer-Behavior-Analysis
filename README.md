# Amazon-Consumer-Behavior-Analysis


This repository contains code and data for analyzing Amazon consumer behavior data. The analysis aims to gain insights into consumer decision-making, habits, and preferences to optimize marketing campaigns and enhance the overall user experience on the site.

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyze more than two weeks of Amazon consumer behavior data. The analysis covers a wide range of variables, including gender, age, user interactions (from browsing to cart completion), reviews, and purchase time patterns.

## Major Questions Explored
To guide our analysis, we have identified four major questions:

* How do age and gender impact consumer behavior?
* What impact does day/ time have on consumer purchases?
* What impact does Consumer reviews have?
* Percentage and impacts of abandonment/browsed and completed carts.
